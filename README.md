# PictureSorter

A little script for Windows (with UI) that goes through a directory full of pictures, reads the date taken from the metadata, and creates new directories for every year and every month and places the pictures in the correct directory.

This was written to help out a friend who was unable to open his photos in Windows Explorer, because the directory was simply too big... So all code very specific for this use case.
